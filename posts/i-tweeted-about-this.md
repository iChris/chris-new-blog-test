It gets me excited thinking how easy services like Netlify have made it to have your own website that isn't yet another WordPress / Squarespace / Wix thing. That you have to do a bit of banging on the engine in order to run every now and then.

That's what inspired [this set of tweets](https://twitter.com/iChris/status/1103041808651767811) and [this video on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbUJfDYW3D4) showing how to set up a blog just like this one for yourself.
